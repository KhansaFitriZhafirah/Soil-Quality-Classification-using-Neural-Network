# Soil-Quality-Classification-and-Crop-Recommendation-using-Neural-Network
A final project for the Artificial Intelligence course that implements a Neural Network model to classify soil quality and recommend optimal crops based on physical and chemical soil parameters. The model achieved 97.95% accuracy on test data, demonstrating its effectiveness in supporting modern, data-driven agriculture.
